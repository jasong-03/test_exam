[Diagram: A composite geometric figure is shown. It consists of a rhombus ABCE and a right-angled triangle CDE. The rhombus ABCE has all four sides (AB, BC, CE, EA) marked with single tick marks, indicating they are of equal length. Angle ABC is labeled as $56^\\circ$. The triangle CDE is attached to side CE of the rhombus. Angle ECD is marked with a right-angle symbol ($90^\\circ$). Angle AED, which is an exterior angle to the rhombus at vertex E, is labeled as $97^\\circ$. The vertices are labeled A, B, C, D, E.]",
