Find the area of the shaded triangle CBD. [Diagram: A composite geometric figure is shown, consisting of a square ABDE and a triangle CDE. The vertices are labeled A, B, C, D, E. Square ABDE is on the left. Triangle CDE extends to the right and upwards from the base DE. A vertical dashed line extends from C downwards to the line containing DE, forming a right angle, and its length is labeled as 20 cm, representing the height of triangle CDE. The triangle CBD is shaded.]",
