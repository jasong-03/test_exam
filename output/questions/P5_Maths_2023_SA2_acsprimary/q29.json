    "text": "In the figure below, ABD is an equilateral triangle and ABCE is a trapezium. CDE is a straight line and $\\angle DAE = 49^\\circ$. Find $\\angle CBD$. [Diagram: A geometric figure is shown. It consists of an equilateral triangle ABD and a trapezium ABCE. Points are labeled A, B, C, D, E. Point A is at the top-left, B at the top-right, E at the bottom-left, D on the base line between E and C, and C at the bottom-right. Line segments AE and BC are vertical and parallel, indicated by single arrows on them, forming the non-parallel sides of the trapezium ABCE. The base EC is horizontal. Triangle ABD is formed by connecting A, B, and D. An angle of $49^\\circ$ is marked at vertex A, specifically for $\\angle DAE$.]",
